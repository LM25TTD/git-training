 Categories: Main dish, African, Ethiopian, Spices
      Yield: 1 cup

      1 lb Unsalted butter
    1/4 c  Chopped onions
      2    Garlic cloves, pressed
      2 ts Grated ginger
    1/2 ts Turmeric
      4    Cardamom seeds, crushed
      1    Cinnamon stick
      2    Whole cloves
    1/4 ts Nutmeg
    1/4 ts Fenugreek
      1 tb Fresh basil

  In a small pot, gradually melt butter & bring to bubbling.  When the
  top is covered in foam, add the other ingredients & reduce heat to a
  simmer. Gently simmer, uncovered, on low heat.  After about 45
  minutes to 1 hour, when the surface becomes transparent & the milk
  solids are on the bottom, pour the liquid through a cheesecloth into
  a heat resistant container. Discard spices & solids.

  Cover tightly & store in the fridge.  Will keep up to 2 months.
