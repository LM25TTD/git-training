  "If there was one dish that could be called typically Acadian, it would
  certainly be Fricot, a soup containing potatoes and meat. The dish has been
  a long time favorite in Acadian households, so much  that the word fricot
  was once synonymous with a good meal and a common call for dinner was
  often, "Vous etes invites au fricot!"... This potato fricot was prepared
  when neither meat nor fish were available, and given the tongue-in-cheek
  name, "Weasel Fricot" (Fricot a la Belette). If you ask Acadians about the
  origin of the name, they will smile and say, "Parce que b'lette a passe
  tout drouete (Because the weasel went right on by.) On Prince Edward it is
  called Fricot a la bezette (Nincompoop Fricot) where bezette roughly
  translates as "nincompoop". It is known as butter fricot, salted her fricot
  and potato fricot, and is often served with a large slice of buttered bread
  and molasses."

  Handkerchief Dumplings (Pates en Mouchior de Poche) Mix flour with salt.
  Gradually add cold water to the dough as one would when making biscuits.
  Roll the dough fairly thin, cut into 1 1/2 inch squares and place the
  squares in the fricot. Cover and simmer 7 minutes.

  Saute the onion and salted herbs in butter for 1-2 minutes or until the
  onion is golden brown. Add the water, potatoes, salt and pepper, and simmer
  for 20 minutes. To thicken the broth, add dumpling or flour mixed with
  water.
