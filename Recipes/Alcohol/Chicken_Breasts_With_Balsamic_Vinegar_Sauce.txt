    Almost every French bistro serves a version of this homey dish. Our
  recipe uses balsamic vinegar and fresh rosemary for a wonderfully simple
  and slightly Italian variation. Serve with steamed or boiled potatoes and a
  salad of baby lettuce.
    Remove all visible fat from chicken.  Spray a large nonstick skillet with
  cooking spray.  Brown chicken breasts over medium-high heat for 3 minutes
  per side. Transfer chicken to a plate. Add onion, garlic, and mushrooms to
  same skillet.  Reduce heat to low and saute until onion is translucent but
  not browned, about 3 minutes. Add vinegar, wine, pepper, salt, and
  rosemary.  Bring mixture to a simmer.  Return chicken pieces to skillet.
  Cover and simmer until chicken breasts are cooked through, about 20
  minutes.
    Transfer chicken to a heated serving platter.  Cook sauce over high heat
  until reduced to about 1/2 cup. Remove from heat and whisk in butter. Pour
  sauce over chicken; garnish with rosemary sprigs.
