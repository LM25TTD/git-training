  of apple. Place in shallow, ungreased baking pan. Mix sugar and cinnamon
  together in small saucepan; add water, lemon and orange slices, and bring
  to a boil. Boil 7 mins. or until syrup is thickened. Discard lemon and
  orange slices. Pour this syrup over the apples, and bake for 30 minutes or
  until fork tender. Baste apples frequently during baking with syrup from
  the pan. They should be nicely glazed when done. To serve warm, let apples
  stand 10-15 minutes before continuing. Also good served cold. Place apple
  in glass dessert bowl, opening the apple sectionsso they spread (like
  flower petals) to fit the bowl. Cut sections deeper if needed to open it
  more easily. Fill center of apple with scoop of ice cream. Drizzle the
  chocolate liqueur sauce over all, and garnish with chopped walnuts. Serve
  immediately.
