      Title: SWEDISH MEATBALLS
 Categories: Meats, Appetizers, Swedish, Usenet
      Yield: 4 servings

    1/2 C  Bread crumbs                        1 lb Meat, ground
    1/2 C  Milk                                     -(mixture of beef
      1 sm Onion                                    -and pork)
      1    Egg                                      Salt and pepper

  Mix bread crumbs and milk.  Let it swell for about 10 minutes.  Mince the
  onion and fry it until soft.  Mix all the ingredients.

  Form into small balls with your hands.  This is easier to do with wet
  hands. The size of the balls can vary a little, but a cherry is too small
  and a ping-pong ball is too big.

  Fry the balls in butter in a frying pan (medium hot) for about 5 minutes.
  Turn them around to get them fried on all sides.  The balls get dark brown.

  NOTES:

  *  A traditional Swedish recipe -- It is served at the smorgasbord and also
  at Christmas in Swedish homes (as one of many dishes). It can also be
  served with brown sauce, potatoes and lingonberry jam at lunch or dinner.
  Kids love the meatballs with pasta.

  *  It's a little bit tricky to get the balls round.  Don't put all the
  meatballs in the frying pan at once.

  : Difficulty:  moderate.
  : Time:  30-40 minutes.
  : Precision:  measure the ingredients.
