           -(use an entire jar)

-----------------------------SHRIMP AND BATTER-----------------------------
      2    Eggs                               48 md Shrimp (peeled),
  1 3/4 C  Flour                                    -with tails
    3/4 C  Beer                                3 C  Coconut (unsweetened),
      1 T  Baking powder                            -grated

  Combine the seasoning mix together in a bowl.  Stir the dipping sauce
  ingredients together in a second bowl.  Have this ready at the table when
  the shrimp are done.

  Mix together about 2 t of the seasoning mix, about 1 1/4 cups of flour, the
  beer and the baking powder, and place this in a third bowl.

  Combine the remaining flour with another 2 t of the seasoning mix.

  Coat each shrimp with the remaining seasoning mix, then in the flour
  mixture, then in the batter, then in the coconut. Deep-fry the shrimp for
  about 1 minute and drain on paper towels.

  NOTES:

  *  Shrimp in coconut beer batter with dipping sauce -- Adapted from Chef
  Paul Prudhomme's "Louisiana Kitchen." A nice appetizer, though very
  caloric.

  *  Don't put too much batter on or it will overwhelm the poor shrimp.  The
  dipping sauce is great for other things as well.

  : Difficulty:  easy if you can deep-fry.
  : Time:  15 minutes preparation, 15 minutes cooking.
  : Precision:  Measure batter, improvise with spices and dipping sauce.
