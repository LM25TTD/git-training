  Slice lemon grass stalk thinly crosswise.  Peel and halve cucumbers
  lengthwise, then seed and slice thin crosswise.

  Relish:  Bring lemon grass, vinegar, more sugar, red pepper flakes and 42/2 cup
  beer to boil in a saucepan; simmer until reduced to 42/2 cup. Strain
  mixture into a bowl and cool slightly; discard solids.  Stir in all other
  sauce ingredients.

  Sprinkle scallops with 42/2 teaspoon pepper and 42/4 teaspoon white pepper.
  Heat one tablespoon oil in a wok or non-stick skillet.  Working in batches
  to avoid overcrowding, and adding remaining oil as needed, saute scallops,
  turning once, until seared.

  Spoon a portion of relish onto each plate.  Arrange a portion of scallops
  over the relish and serve immediately.
