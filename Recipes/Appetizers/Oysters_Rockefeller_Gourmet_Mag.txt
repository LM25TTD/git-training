  parsley, celery, and garlic.  In a skillet, met butter over moderate heat
  and cook the spinach mixture, stirring for 1-2 minutes, or until greens are
  wilted.  Stir in the Pernod, anchovy paste, cayenne, and salt and pepper to
  taste.  Chill the mixture, covered, for 1 hour. In another skillet, cook
  bacon over moderate heat until crisp. Transfer to paper towels to drain,
  and then crumble it. Arrange one oyster in each of the reserved shells and
  moisten each with some of the reserved liquor. Spread half the spinach
  mixture by heaping tablespoons onto the oysters. Sprinkle bacon over each
  oyster.  Top the bacon with remaining spinach mixture and sprinkle each
  with 1 Tbsp of remaining bread crumbs. Arrange oysters on an oven proof
  platters filled with coarse salt. Bake in the middle of a preheated 450f
  oven for 18 minutes or until bread crumbs are well browned. Garnish with
  parsley sprigs and lemon wedges and serve. a 1976 Gourmet Mag. favorite
