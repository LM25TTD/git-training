     Title: Garlic Straws - NSVhol
Categories: Appetizers, Nsv
     Yield: 20 straws

   1/2 lb Puff pastry
          Juice of 2-3 garlic cloves
     2 oz Milk
     1 ts Paprika
     1 tb Parmesan cheese
          Salt and cayenne pepper

Preheat oven to 425F. Roll out the puff pastry on a floured board into
a rectangle, as thinly as possible. Stir the garlic juice into most of
the milk and brush the pastry with half of it.  Mix the paprika and
Parmesan, and season with a little salt and cayenne. Sprinkle half of
it over one half of the pastry. Fold the pastry and  roll out as thinly
as possible.

Repeat with the remaining garlic milk and Parmesan mixture and roll out
to a rectangle not more than 1/4 inch thick. Brush with milk and  cut
into strips about 1/2 inch wide and 6 inches long.

Arrange the straws, at least an inch apart, on greased baking sheets
and bake for 7 to 10 minutes or until well-risen and golden brown. Serve
warm, piled onto each other, log cabin style.

Since my grandmother can no longer cook the large main dishes, the
job now falls to me and my mother.  I'll let mom do the turkey this
year (she always gets up before me anyway!) and I'll make the ham.
This recipe doubles nicely if you use a light touch with the
mustard and vinegar.
