   Servings:  1

      2 c  Flour
    1/2 lb Butter
    1/2 lb Cream Cheese


      2 oz Goose Liver Paste
      1 ts Worcestershire Sauce
      1 ts Steak Sauce
           Or:
      2 oz Ground Ham
      1 ts Steak Sauce
      1 ts Catsup
           Or:
           Anchovy Paste
           Or:
           Caviar

  Work into the flour the butter and cream cheese. Chill thoroughly... over
  night is not too long. Take pieces of dough and roll very thin, as quickly
  as possible. Cut with a round cookie cutter, size of a water glass or
  larger if desired. Mix together ingredients for one of the fillings. Spread
  on dough, fold over and bake at 400øF until brown. These may be shaped
  earlier and baked just before serving. Serve as an appetizer with beer,
  except the anchovy or caviar which should be served with cocktails. Make
  the anchovy and caviar appetizers somewhat smaller than the ones that are
  to be served with beer. Source: Pennsylvania Dutch Cook Book - Fine Old
