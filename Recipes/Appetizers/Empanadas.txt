 Categories: Appetizers
   Servings:  4

    1/4 lb Unsalted butter
      2 c  All purpose flour
      1 ts Baking powder
    1/2 ts Salt (or to taste)
      2    Yolks of large eggs
    1/4 c  Chilled water
    1/2 lb Ground lean beef
    1/2 c  Chopped white onions
      2 tb Seedless raisins
      2 tb Chopped black or green
           -olives
    1/2 ts Ground red pepper (Cayenne)
    1/2 ts Oregano
    1/2 ts Salt

  1.  Cut the butter into 1/4 inch cubves.

  2.  Place the flour, baking powder, salt, and butter in a mixing bowl.
  Combine the ingredients with a pastry cutter (or with the steel blade in a
  food processor).

  3.  Beat the egg yolks.  Mix half of them into the flour mixture. Reserve
  the remainder for step 12.

  4.  Incorporate the water slowly into the flour mixture until the dough
  becomes a cohesive and semifirm mass.

  5.  Shape the sough into two balls.  Wrap them in plastic wrap and
  refrigerate them for 15 minutes.

  6.  Preheat the oven to 375 degrees F.

  7.  Heat the oil in a large saute pan or skillet over moderate heat. Saute
  the meat for 3 minutes, stirring frequently. Transfer the meat with a
  slotted spoon to a warm bowl.

  8.  Add the onions to the pan and saute them over low to moderate heat for
  3 minutes, stirring frequently. (Add 1 or 2 extra teaspoons of oil if
  necessary).

  9.  Return the meat to the pan and add the remaining ingredients. Cook the
  mixture for 1 minute, stirring constantly. Reserve it for step 11.

  10.  Roll each ball of dough on a lightly floured board into a 1/8-inch
  thick sheet. Using a cookie cutter with a 4- to 5-inch diameter, cut out
  rounds. Collect the scraps and repeat step 10 until the dough is used up.

  11.  Place one tablespoon of the meat mixture in the center of each dough
  round. Lightly moisten the exposed dough with cold tap water. Fold each
  round in half, creating a half-moon shape. Crimp the two edges of dough
  together, so that the stuffing cannot ooze out during the baking step.

  12.  Brush the tops of the uncooked empanadas with the remaining egg yolk.

  13.  Place the uncooked empanadas on an ungreased baking sheet. Bake them
  in the middle of the oven until the tops become light golden brown (roughly
  20 minutes). Serve the empanadas fresh from the oven.

  Serves 4.
